PCI-DSS conform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The e-payment interface is conform with Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard (PCI DSS). PCI DSS is in place to make the internet
safer and more secure by ensuring that the sensitive data of your
customers is handled in a recognised and secure manner.

PAYMILL supports merchants to be PCI DSS compliant. Your clients'
sensitive data is sent directly to PAYMILL. The sensitive data never
touches your servers and this drastically reduces the scope of your
compliance requirements.

See details in the section Workflow below.
