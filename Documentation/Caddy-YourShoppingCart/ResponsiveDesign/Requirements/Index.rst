Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^


Powermail 2.x
"""""""""""""

Caddy is a team-play with Powermail 1.x or 2.x. If you like to use
caddy responsive, you have to use Powermail 2.x.


TYPO3 6.x
"""""""""

Caddy fits Powermail 2.x in the responsive design of Foundation. The
modification isn't compatible with TYPO3 4.x. You need TYPO3 6.x.


TYPO3 Foundation
""""""""""""""""

If you don't know anything about Foundation or if you don't like to
install and configure Foundation manually, you are welcome to use the
extension TYPO3 Foundation (t3foundation). The extension has ready-to-
use templates for TYPO3.

You don't need to know anything about this, if you want to use
Foundation for Caddy only. But if you are interested in detailed
information, please take a look here:
