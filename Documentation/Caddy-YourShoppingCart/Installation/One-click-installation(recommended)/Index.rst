One-Click-Installation (recommended)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The one-click-installation is recommended `:sup:`1`
<#sdfootnote2sym>`_ .


Advantages
""""""""""

The advantages of the one-click-installations are:

- You will have a minimum of costs for the installation and the
  configuration:
  
  You will need
  
  - the first time 30 minutes over all and
  
  - all next times 15 minutes over all.

- You will get a running sample with caddy and without
  
  - any unproper configuration and
  
  - any costs for debugging.

- A running sample is the best for understanding.

- You can test all features of caddy immediately. Play with Caddy!

- If something goes wrong and you can't cancel it, it doesn't matter.
  
  - Waste your installation.
  
  - Repeat the one-click-installation.


Work flow for your own needs
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- The one-click-installation offers three Caddy samples:
  
  - for ordering documents `:sup:`2`  <#sdfootnote3sym>`_
  
  - for reserving tickets `:sup:`3`  <#sdfootnote4sym>`_
  
  - for selling items `:sup:`4`  <#sdfootnote5sym>`_

- If no one of the three samples doesn't match your needs,
  
  - waste Caddy,
  
  - look for another TYPO3 extension, which could match your needs, or
  
  - develop your own extension.

- If one of the three samples matches your needs,
  
  - you can move the page with the Caddy within the page tree to your
    preferred position,
  
  - you have to adapt Caddy with the Constant Editor to your needs, and
  
  - you have to take care, that your order form address all needed values
    to the page with the Caddy plugin.
