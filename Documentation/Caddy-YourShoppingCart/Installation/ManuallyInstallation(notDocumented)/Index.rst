Manually Installation (not documented)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The manually installation of Caddy is complex and isn't recommended.
The cause is:

- Caddy isn't a shop.

- Caddy is a shopping cart only.

Because Caddy is a shopping cart only, Caddy has interfaces for third
party extensions for

- managing items (done by the Quick Shop, the Organiser or your
  extension) and

- interactive actions with the customer (done by Powermail)

A manually installation has a lot of possibilities for an unproper
configuration.

And the manual for a manually installation has a lot of possibilities
for unproper or missing statements too.

I would be happy, if you are appreciative of a missing documentation
for a manually installation.
